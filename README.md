# LFI Scanner Tool


## Overview

The LFI Scanner Tool is a Python script designed to help security professionals and web developers identify potential Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities in web applications. LFI vulnerabilities can expose sensitive server-side files and compromise the security of an application.

This tool automates the process of testing URLs with various payloads to detect signs of LFI vulnerabilities. It leverages the power of Selenium for browser automation and multithreading for efficient scanning.

## Features

- Utilizes Selenium for browser automation to interact with web pages
- Supports multithreaded scanning for faster results
- Randomized colorful banner for a visually appealing introduction
- Customizable payloads for testing different scenarios
- Reports potential LFI vulnerabilities in the form of vulnerable URLs

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Aniruddhpathak404/LFI-SCAN`
2. Run the script: `python lfi-scan.py`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the target URL and desired number of scanning threads.

## Disclaimer

**Please use this tool responsibly and only on systems you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning and testing can be illegal and unethical.**
